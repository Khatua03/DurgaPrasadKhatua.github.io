## Brief Biography

Dr. Durga Prasad Khatua is a Postdoctoral Research Scholar in the **Physics and Astronomy Department at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), USA**. His research spans ultrafast dynamics, high-intensity light–matter interactions, ion acceleration, and laser-driven fusion, alongside advanced plasma diagnostics. He is actively engaged in the design and development of **mm-wave Doppler backscattering (DBS) systems** for turbulence and flow studies in spherical tokamaks, contributing to **MAST-U experiments** aimed at understanding plasma instabilities and ion cyclotron emission (ICE).

Dr. Khatua earned his **Ph.D. in Physics (2022)** from the **Homi Bhabha National Institute (HBNI), Raja Ramanna Centre for Advanced Technology (RRCAT), Indore, India**. His doctoral thesis, *“Ultrafast Photoexcited Carrier Dynamics in Two-Dimensional Molybdenum Disulfide,”* focused on ultrafast carrier dynamics in monolayer and multilayer MoS₂, with implications for next-generation optoelectronic devices. He also holds both a **Master’s and a Bachelor’s degree in Physics** from **Utkal University, Bhubaneswar, India**.

With expertise in **ultrafast spectroscopy, quantum optics, and photonic instrumentation**, Dr. Khatua has developed multiple custom optical setups—including femtosecond pump–probe systems, micro-PL/micro-absorption platforms, and mm-wave RF systems—to address challenges in both **quantum materials** and **plasma physics**.
