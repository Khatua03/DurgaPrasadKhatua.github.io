excerpt: "This study explores transient carrier dynamics in monolayer MoS<sub>2</sub> at high excitation densities, a regime important for applications in lasers, optical parametric amplifiers, and high-power detectors. The optical response shows that carriers, excited directly to the A-exciton state, undergo exciton dissociation and hot-carrier generation, followed by exciton formation on the picosecond timescale. At elevated fluences, excitons display longer lifetimes, indicating a bottlenecking process. These fluence-dependent relaxation pathways are crucial for optimizing MoS<sub>2</sub>-based optoelectronic devices."
