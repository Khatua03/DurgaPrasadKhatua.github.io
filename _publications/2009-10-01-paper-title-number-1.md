title: "Pump fluence dependent carrier dynamics at the A-exciton of MoS<sub>2</sub>: Monolayer vs. Bulk"

permalink: /publication/2024-mos2-carrier-dynamics
excerpt: "We investigated carrier dynamics in monolayer and multilayer MoS<sub>2</sub> at photo-doping densities near the Mott limit. Despite similar band structures near the K-point, marked differences emerge due to exciton dissociation, bandgap renormalization, and intervalley relaxation, offering key insights into MoS<sub>2</sub> optoelectronics."
